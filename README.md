## Takeout

The TakeoutFM server, known as *Takeout*, indexes organized media files in S3
(or local) using MusicBrainz, ListenBrainz, Last.fm, Fanart.tv, and TMDB.
Indexed media is browsed using Takeout APIs and securely streamed directly from
S3 or local storage. Music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and radio are
supported. Takeout is built as a single binary that includes all server
functionality including media syncing, streaming, REST APIs, and a builtin web
UI.
